# GrammifyAI

GrammifyAI is a minimalist macOS utility for improving your writing in almost every language, thanks to OpenAI.
It uses the OpenAI API with your API key.

GrammifyAI can access your text in nearly any application, as it utilizes the Accessibility API.

The usage of GrammifyAI is as simple as selecting the text and pressing shortcut (⌘ + U or custom).  
This will show you the improvement suggestion popup and will copy the suggestion to the clipboard.

  5. Select the text in any application and press ⌘ + U or your custom shortcut

## Update
  After installing a new version you need to remove the GrammifyAI from Accessibility permissions and give them again.

## Known successfull use cases
I use the application in *Slack*, *Chrome* and *Notion*.  

## Known limitations
It doesn't work in *Google Docs*

## Motivation for implementing this applications
I would like to check my writing as easily as possible, especially in a new language for me (German).  
There are awesome applications like Grammarly that do a very similar job,  
but unfortunately, they only support English, and the AI capabilities can be a bit expensive.  
I would also like to perform the check with a simple key press and minimal UI interaction.
