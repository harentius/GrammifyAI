# GrammifyAI

An AI-driven grammar and spell checker for macOS that works everywhere and with any language.

The usage of GrammifyAI is as simple as selecting the text and pressing a shortcut (⌘ + U or custom).  
This will bring you the improvement suggestion popup and will copy the suggestion to the clipboard.

Thanks to the macOS accessibility API, GrammifyAI can work with text in any **web** or **native** application.  
Thanks to **OpenAI**, GrammifyAI also improves your writting and language style.

GrammifyAI uses your OpenAI keys, so no quota or limits from GrammifyAI side: use according to OpenAI billing.

## Installation
  1. Download the latest release and move it to the Applications folder on your Mac.
  2. To run the application, right-click on the GrammifyAI app name and select "Open," then allow it to open.
  3. To add application Accessibility permissions, open "System Settings" navigate to "Privacy & Security" select "Accessibility" and add GrammifyAI to the list.
  4. Add your OpenAI API key in the Settings.
  5. Select the text in any application and press ⌘ + U or your custom shortcut.

## Update
  After installing a new version you need to remove the GrammifyAI from Accessibility permissions and give them again.  
  You might need to perform step 2 from installation process again.

## Known successful use cases
I use the GrammifyAI application in *Slack*, *Chrome*, *Notion*, *Messenger*, and any standard web form.  

## Known limitations

## Motivation for implementing this applications
I would like to check my writing as easily as possible, especially in a new language for me (German).  
There are awesome applications like Grammarly that do a very similar job,  
but unfortunately, they only support English, and the AI capabilities can be a bit expensive.  
I would also like to perform the check with a simple key press and minimal UI interaction.
