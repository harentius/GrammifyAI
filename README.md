# GrammifyAI

An AI-driven grammar and spell checker for macOS that works everywhere and with any language.

The usage of GrammifyAI is as simple as selecting the text and pressing a shortcut (⌘ + U or custom).  
This will bring you the improvement suggestion popup and will copy the suggestion to the clipboard.

Thanks to the macOS accessibility API, GrammifyAI can work with text in any web or native application.

## Known successfull use cases
I use the GrammifyAI application in *Slack*, *Chrome* and *Notion*.  

## Known limitations
It doesn't work in *Google Docs*

## Motivation for implementing this applications
I would like to check my writing as easily as possible, especially in a new language for me (German).  
There are awesome applications like Grammarly that do a very similar job,  
but unfortunately, they only support English, and the AI capabilities can be a bit expensive.  
I would also like to perform the check with a simple key press and minimal UI interaction.
